**Abstract**
-------------



The Binary Options Industry is a multi-billion dollar market. Just in Israel, binary options broker companies made $5 billion profit in 2016 [1]. 

When you buy a binary option from centralized brokers, you actually bet against the platform. The broker makes money when you lose. 

> This means that the broker must make sure it wins more than it loses[2]

 Traders are playing an unfair game as broker/platform can cheat on them by manipulating the price feed in their favor and block traders from withdrawing. So traders may win the trade but loss their money.

BlockOptions.io aim to build an independent and decentralized platform for the binary options industry.

 

 - Pure P2P market -  Traders bet against Bankrollers, BlockOptions.io'token holders make profit from trading fees; not from profit share as traditional platforms.
 - Guaranteed Payout - Payments are issued by smart contract direct to traders ETH address. No one can block withdraws.
 - 100% Transparency and Provably Fair by getting assets price on blockchain. Therefor cheating by manipulating price feed is impossible .

We will show you how we build this 100% on-chain system, as we believe the foundations on ethereum blockchain are solid and can support a high user friendly Dapp.


**1. Introduction**
-------------




BlockOptions.io is a decentralized Binary Options Platform based on Ethereum blockchain. We do not bet against traders but provide a larger catalog of assets marketplace by letting bankrollers create varied asset contracts by themselves on our platform, e.g. 70 seconds EUR/USD, 3 minutes BTC/USD, 8 hours GOLD, etc..

*1.1 Binary Options Industry*
-----------------------------




Binary options "are based on a simple 'yes' or 'no' proposition: Will an underlying asset be above a certain price at a certain time? [3]

 And binary options are often considered a form of gambling rather than investment because of their negative cumulative payout (the brokers have an edge over the investor) and because they require little or no knowledge of the market. 

> This sort of thing can quickly become addictive... no one, no matter
> how knowledgeable can consistently predict what a stock or commodity
> will do within a short time frame. [4]

One of the biggest binary options platform in the United States makes almost 1M profit per day. IG Group, One of the top company made $305.1 million of net trading revenue in 2016.[5].

Binary options seem to have more funds compare to dice game, and there is no leading blockchain binary options platform running right now. BlockOptions.io will have big potential as it is the no.1 blockchain binary options platform in the market.

*1.2. Common Issues in Binary Options Industry*
-----------------------------------------------



Some of the existing issues in the binary options market that blockOptions.io can solve:

 - Funding problem into your account - In BlockOptions.io you are trading with your ether wallet, no need to wait for any broker to help credit your account.

 - Price data feed manipulating - just a small change can influence the result of a trade. By using BlockOptions.io no one can change the price data as it is being fetched by smart contract and stored in blockchain.

 - Delay or block withdraw - When a binary options broker delay or blocks you withdraw, you can't do anything about it. By using BlockOptions.io you will be rewarded direct to your ETH address by smart contract automatically and immediately.

 - Not safe funds -  On non-regulated platforms, the client's money is not necessarily kept in a trusted account as required by government financial regulations. Again, transactions are not monitored by third parties in order to ensure fair play."[6] By using BlockOptions.io, every transaction and bankroll funds are viewable on ethereum blockchain. Traders will get guaranteed payout if they win.

 - Not provably fair game - Traders bet against brokers/platform in traditional platforms, it can't be provably fair even if it's a regulated platform. Traders bet against bankrollers in BlockOptions.io and win rates and rewards rate are 100% transparent and unchangeable.

 - Company shut down or run away - Traders will lost all their money if broker company shuts down or is run away. It is the worst situation many traders face. By using BlockOptions.io all funds are safe even BlockOptions.io platform can't access the funds since all funds are stored on ethereum blockchain. 

 - Server or account hacked - In BlockOptions.io all your trades and funds are safer than traditional platform as it is 'impossible' to hack the ethereum blockchain.



*1.3 The following table compares typical binaty options broker and BlockOptions.io platform.*
------------------------------------------------------------------------





|  Compares    | Typical Brokers | BlockOptions.io   |
| :----------  | :---------- | :---------- |
| Transparency | Very Little |  100% Transparency    |
| Manipulable  | Uncertain   |  Can't   |
| Guaranteed Payout     | Uncertain    |  Yes  |
| Fund Safety     | Uncertain    |  Yes  |
| Provably Fair     | Uncertain    |  Yes  |
| Platform Safe     | Uncertain    |  Yes  |





**2. The Platform**
-------------



Blockoptions.io is the first decentralized binary options platform based on ethereum blockchain with BOPT (a standard etheriun ERC20 token) used as an in-trade currency and profit dividend token. Blockoptions.io completely and permanently eradicate the inauspicious decease called 'TRUST' which is undoubtedly killing the binary options industry from inside out.


BOPT - BlockOptions.io internal token - is used as dividend (100% of the profit generating by BlockOptions.io platform goes to token holders as dividend) and as second in-game currency. 

We will release an MVP in July 2017 and publish further development plans according to the road-map after ICO.

*2.1 How it works?*
-----------------


Built 100% on blockchain, BlockOptions.io fetches asset price data from an oracle by using Orcalize service running on smart contract. We will use a build-in wallet to fetch start time price and pass it to smart contract, compare the start time price, expiry price and reward winning traders immediately by smart contract. No additional database and server-side needed. Not even the slightest window for cheating and scams. No delay payments and deny payments. Although we will simplify this in the MVP version, but it will be implemented eventually.

*2.2 Roles*
---------


**2.2.1 Platform**





We aim to provide the best binary options platform in the market by providing a provably fair, guaranteed Payout, 100% transparency, highest reward rate and best user friendly system to traders, obtaining more daily trade volume to make more profit. BlockOptions.io Platform doesn't make money from traders loss but from fees per trade (planning charge 0.005-0.01 ETH per trade, actual fee per trade will be published before public version release).






**2.2.2 Quote provider**



2.2.2.1 MVP version: Uses cryptocompare.com as quote provider. “At CryptoCompare we pride ourselves in showing the most accurate live prices, charting and market analysis from 37 of the top crypto exchanges globally. Our content editors keep the mining data, be it company, mining equipment or mining contracts up to date with the latest pricing and products available on the market. ” [7]

2.2.2.2 Later versions: Use xignite as quote provider. Xignite provides very high quality quotes to many different banks and platforms.

“Xignite, pronounced ex-ig-nite,  stands for Igniting Exchanges. We have sparked a FinTech revolution, the first to coin that term way back in 2014, and today we are fueling the digital transformation of financial services.” [8]

**2.2.4 Oracle**


In a nutshell, an oracle is something (or someone) that provides data to blockchain applications that these applications cannot (efficiently) access by themselves.

Oracles are necessary because it is inefficient and often impossible to reach a decentralized consensus on centralized data. [9]

*2.4 Roadmap*
-----------

 - Build app to attract mobile traders, this will increase our user base up to at least 200%

 - Multiple language supported and expand more offices to more regions

 - Public released on Dec. 2017 and more marketing budget and PR, we aid to build the No.1 blockchain binary option brand.




**3. How we achieve the 100% onchain platform**
-------------
*To achieve the 100% onchain platform, BlockOptions.io won’t need account registration, off-chain server side, additional database, man power to audit funding/trading/withdrawing, but will only reply on ethereum blockchain.*




*3.1 How the traditional binary options brokers works*
-------------
The traditional binary options platform also known as the only brokers trade against traders. Traders register/login to system, funding with fiat money via credit card/PayPal/Wire transfer to broker’s account, get account credited after broker’s auditing. Trading and rewarding by broker’s server side, the price feed also provided by broker’s server side. And how much and when traders get their withdraw is also processed by brokers. It can’t be a provably fair game as brokers makes money while traders loss.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/VVzhlmc.png)


*3.1.1 Traditional binary option sites using Bitcoin*


Some sites claim to be blockchain binary options platforms, whereas they only provide trading and withdraw with bitcoin, such as satoshioption.com, secondstrade.com and other sites you can google them with phrase: ”blockchain bianry options”. Their trading are still running based on server site informations, and the withdraw part mostly need to be manually approved. They still belong to Traditional platforms category just using the fashionable bitcoin payment method.

There are  so many problems with these types of companies and so many scams, so the binary options industry is in critical state where risk and trust problems are the oder of the day. many countries have banned it or limited it.[10]

So we are going to rebuild the binary option industry with blockchain technology following this steps in the list below:




*3.2 First 100% on onchain binary options platform*
-------------------------------------------------




*3.2.1 Fetch data from reliable quote provider*


We will use smart contract service oraclize.it to fetch price from quote provider’s API to insure that the price data is accurate and can not be changed. 




*3.2.2 MVP*

 1. Traders send ETH/OPT direct from 3rd wallet, e.g. MEW to trading
    smart contract, at the same time trading smart contract sending a
    transaction to Oraclize’s smart contract. After some blocks time, 30
    seconds – 1 min. Oraclize’s smart contract bring back start price.
    
 2. And we also schedule a callback in the transaction Oraclize’s smart

 3. In 2 minutes + a few block time later, Oraclize callback trading
    smart contract with expiry price, traders get e.g. 175% of trading
    amount as reward by trading smart contract if win or 1 gwei if lost.

----------
*3.2.3 The UI of MVP:*

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/Wa61IXd.png)

The MVP will be release online for test before tokensale, test address will be online soon.

Although the MVP is a 100% onchain system, with auto reward, 100% transparent, can’t be manipulated, guaranteed payout and provably fair, but it have some weak points need to improve urgently.

 - The start price will be delayed in 1min. 
 - Traders have to open ETH wallet to send ETH to smart contract, not very user friendly
 - Expiry time is not exactly e.g 2 Min. later time, the perdition is not traders wanted.




*3.3 Build-in wallet version on public chain*
----------


So a build-in wallet version is needed. It will fix the start time delay, expiry time not accurate and can’t accept BTC to trade, etc problems.

 1. Traders create an online wallet on BlockOptions.io or import their
    private key to BlockOptions.io as other online wallets like
    https://www.myetherwallet.com/.
    
 2. Traders click invest button to start trading on BlockOptions.io
    Build-in wallet will fetch start price within the same second.

 3. At the same time sending a schedule callback to Oraclize’s smart
    contract, e.g callback with exactly 2 min. later price using
    timestamp parameter for xignite API. This will get back the expiry
    price exact equal (start time + 2 minutes)’s price from ethereum
    blockchain.
    
 4. In 2 minutes + a few block time later, Oraclize callback trading
    smart contract with expiry price, traders get e.g. 175% of trading
    amount as reward by trading smart contract if win or 1 gwei if lost.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/zsZs9Y6.png)


The UI of build-in wallet version will be similar to this, with one click traders can start a trade on site, no need to open 3rd wallet.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/761HS1b.png)

This version fixes the start time delay and expiry time not accurate problem plus all advantages MVP had. But still have a shortage: 

 - need to pay too many TX fee to ethereum blockchain miners (needs to
   pay 3 times TX fee for a trade, it will raise as price of ETH will 
   rise in future and it is about $$1 per TX fee at the price of $300
   per ETH).



*3.4 Build a less TX fee platform*
----------


In this version we would like to achieve a less TX fee but still 100% onchain platform for binary options industry. We will bring in private chain + public chain structure.

 1. Traders create a new wallet or import private key to BlockOptions.io
    and traders confirm how many ETH they would like used to trade,
    BlockOptions.io will transfer the fund from public chain to private
    chain.
 2. Traders start trade as usual, the trading smart contract is executed
    in private chain, and the reward is stored in private chain too.
    When traders would like to end trades, BlockOptions.io will transfer
    the fund to public chain from private chain.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/8j1QL4h.png)

Although in the last version, the traders only need to pay one TX fee, but other TX fees still come from traders in the end. BlockOptions.io can provide the highest reward rate to traders only by reducing any costs as much as possible, in private chain + public chain version, we also can reduce the Oraclize service’s cost by bring in are own oracle service. 

As only need to pay 2 TX fees to complete dozens or hundreds of trades, we will be the first batch of platforms that can achieve such minimum avg. TX fee per trade on the market.

One big plus for using private chain to process trading, we can get back results to traders near to real time as we can use 1-2 seconds block time in private chain,  much faster than only use public chain.

**Conclusion**
-------------




The competition is very fierce in binary options industry, traditional binary option brokers pay more than $300 to affiliate to get a new traders. Although we believe we can and will build the best blockchain binary options platform on market, but we still need pay more attentions on marketing, PR, networking and helps from communities to achieve it.
